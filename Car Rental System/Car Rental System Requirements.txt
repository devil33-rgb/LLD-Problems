🚗 Vehicle Booking & Rental System — Low Level Design in Python

I designed and implemented a mini vehicle rental system to practice object-oriented design, state management, and service-layer architecture.

✅ Functional Requirements Implemented

1️⃣ User Management

System should support users who can book, rent, and return vehicles.

Each user should have a unique identity and location context.

2️⃣ Vehicle Inventory Management

System should store vehicles grouped by location.

Vehicles must track availability status.

Each vehicle should have a unique identifier (plate number).

3️⃣ Vehicle Booking

Users should be able to book a vehicle by type and location.

Booking should assign a specific available vehicle.

Booking should maintain lifecycle states:
→ BOOKED
→ RENTED
→ COMPLETED

4️⃣ Vehicle Rental

Only booked vehicles can be rented.

Renting a vehicle should update both:
• vehicle availability
• booking status

5️⃣ Vehicle Return

Users should be able to return rented vehicles.

Returning should:
• mark vehicle available
• complete booking

6️⃣ Booking Tracking

System should maintain all booking records.

System should support retrieval of all bookings.

7️⃣ User Booking History

System should track bookings per user.
